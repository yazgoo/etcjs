Cache:
    Here is how the cache (beetwin parenthesis) works:
        - if server answers to ping:
            client <===> (interface <===> kernel <===> client) <===> server
                                            ||
                                            \/
                                       (storage lib)
        - if server did not answer to last ping:
            client <===> (interface <===> kernel <===> storage lib)
